## Entry Points for Contributors

**Start anywhere. Fork freely. No permission needed.**

### Story Entry Points

- Write a scene from Kwame Asare's perspective during his detention and journey to the Tower, exploring the 'original covenant' he carries.
- Create a dossier from Major Ransom's files on a secondary character (e.g., the Soviet advisor, a soldier at the checkpoint), revealing the state's pervasive surveillance.
- Draft a 'lost' poem by Kwame Asare, written in exile, that metaphorically predicts the Tower's corruption.
- Write a chapter from the perspective of the city itself—the old quarters resisting the geometric new sectors—as a living, gothic entity.

### Technical Entry Points

- Build a 3D model or interactive map of the People's Unity Tower, detailing its symbolic architecture (sub-level archive, viewing chamber, ballroom).
- Create a 'propaganda vs. reality' generator that takes state broadcaster announcements (like 'The Midnight Sun') and outputs the grim, underlying truth.
